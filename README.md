## Getting started

Contributions of bug fixes and new functionality, documentation, and tests are
always appreciated.

### In npm-based projects
When including solid-ui in an npm-based project, you can use it with:

```js
  import { ns, rdf,  acl, aclControl, create, dom, icons, log, matrix, media,
  messageArea, infiniteMessageArea, pad, preferences, style, table, tabs, utils, widgets, versionInfo
} from 'solid-ui'

```
### Directly in a webpage
Clone this repo, and in the repo root run:

* `npm install`
* `npm run build`

This will generate a `dist/` folder containing, among other artifacts, `dist/main.js`.
Now run `npx serve` and go to http://localhost:3000/Documentation/ with your browser to see some examples.

While viewing one of those examples, you can open the web console in your browser and for instance
try how you can create a button:
```js
const solidLogo = 'https://solidproject.org/assets/img/solid-emblem.svg'
const myButton = UI.widgets.button(document, solidLogo, 'test', () => window.alert('clicked!'))
UI.widgets.clearElement(document.body)
document.body.appendChild(myButton)
```

Or a chat widget:
```js
const chatChannel = 'https://example-user.inrupt.net/public/example-chat/index.ttl#this'
const chat = UI.infiniteMessageArea(document, store, UI.rdf.namedNode(chatChannel))
document.body.appendChild(chat)
```

### Development new components

When developing a component in solid-ui you can test it in isolation using storybook

```
npm run build
npm run storybook
```

If there is no story for the component yet, add a new one to `./src/stories`.

When you want to test the component within a solid-pane, you can use the [development mode of solid-panes](https://github.com/solidos/solid-panes#development).
