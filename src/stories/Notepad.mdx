## notepad: Creates a notepad

In this first example we'll see how you can create a notepad. This method creates input fields
which allow you to provide a notepad component to your application.

The inputs will be stored to [https://example-user.inrupt.net/public/example-notepad/index.ttl#this](https://example-user.inrupt.net/public/example-notepad/index.ttl#this)

## notepadToHTML: Converts a Turtle file to an HTML

## lightColorHash : Determines a color to be used for a participants notepad entry

This method returns a hex value for setting the color of the input box of the notepad. It does this by hashing the uri passed in as an argument. Ideally this would be the uri of the person logged in.

## renderParticipants: Creates a table of participants on a given notepad document
